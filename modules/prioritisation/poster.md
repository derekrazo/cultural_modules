Prioritisation
==============

Spend time on what's most important

1. collect all the things we could talk about (or do), without going into them
2. rank them based on agreed criteria
3. discuss the most important ones
4. deal with the lower priority items another way

The order in which items are brought up isn't necessarily their order of importance. If you immediately discuss each topic as it arises, you might run out of time to talk about important stuff.

**Warnings**
- review your prioritisation process regularly. The importance of some things are understood by only a minority of people, or by quiet people, etc. If these things are never prioritised, your group is at risk.
- prioritisation requires discipline to separate analysis from content.
