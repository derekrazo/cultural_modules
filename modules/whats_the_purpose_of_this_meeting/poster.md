What is the purpose of this meeting?
===================================

  check everyone has shared expectations about the topic

how:
----

1. wait until everyone is ready to start
2. ask "What is the purpose of this meeting?" 
3. resolve any differences in understanding
4. reflect a plan / summary back to the group
5. proceed with the meeting



why:
---

Meetings run more smoothly when everyone is talking about the same topic. People may have different assumptions about the purpose. Making it explicit lets you resolve any differences.


warnings:
---------

- Step 2: Some people will probably feel like the purpose of the meeting is obvious. This doesn't necessarily mean everyone has the same assumptions. It can be valuable to remind people that it's just a quick check and might save time.

- Step 3:  If a lot of different ideas come up, including them all might  make your meeting really long or annoy some people. You can resolve this by agreeing on an agenda, or organizing other meetings for distinct topics.

- Having a clear purpose doesn't always mean having a strict structure. For example, you might decide the purpose is just to explore ideas in an relaxed conversation, or brainstorming.
