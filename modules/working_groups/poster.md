Working Groups
==============

Do work using as few people as possible, but not fewer

1. Ask "Can a smaller group take this forward?"
2. Delegate the work to them with a clear mandate
3. Define how and when they will report back to the larger group

Working with a large group is slow and expensive, and often not as effective. Not everyone should be involved in everything. Defining pieces of work and delegating them to a subset of the group who has a the interest, time, or skills can be a better use of time.

**Warnings**
- make sure you have clear decision-making checkpoints. The working group needs to know when they should move ahead, and when they should check back with everyone. Also, people who are not in the working group will be reassured that they can have input

**jargon**
- mandate
