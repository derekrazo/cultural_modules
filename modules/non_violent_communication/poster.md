Non-violent Communication
=========================

Use non-violent communication to ask others to change

1. Say what you notice (facts)
2. Explain why it's important to you (feelings)
3. Express your wish (request for change)

Being conscious and respectful when we ask others to change can reduce conflict. If others understand why you are making a request, they might be more likely to accomodate you. There is no objective truth or right answer - we all have our own subjective perspective. Recognising this helps smooth out interactions.

**Warnings**
- Stick to genuine "I" statements. Don't rephrase coercive demands into this format to manupulate, or you will lose trust.
- Just because you express a request in this way doesn't mean it will always be accepted. Make sure you listen to other's perspectives and compromise.
